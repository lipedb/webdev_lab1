# webdev_lab1

my first lab

**A modest first step into the chaotic beauty of web development.**

This is my first web lab. It's a simple static site built using only HTML and CSS, but designed with actual software architecture principles in mind â€” because even the smallest project deserves respect.

## What's inside

This lab showcases a personal landing page that features:

- A circular photo on the left (classic move)
- A background image (slightly dramatic)
- A speech bubble that introduces me
- Language content loaded from a separate HTML file (`/languages/en.html`)
- All built without a single line of JavaScript
